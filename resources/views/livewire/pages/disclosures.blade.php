                    <p class="text-muted-foreground mb-6">
                        For insurance products, CostPlus Life Insurance processes insurance-related business through established Managing General Agents (MGAs), who will pay us, or direct the insurance company to pay us, a commission and/or bonus earned from the sale of insurance products that we place. This bonus constitutes a portion of the overall compensation we receive in conjunction with the commissions referenced below. We have full discretion to deal with any insurer with whom we trade, and we are not subject to pressure from any MGA to favor one insurer over another.
